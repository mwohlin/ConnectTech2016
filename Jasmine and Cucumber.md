**Traditional TDD**

- Write a failing Unit Test
- Make the Unit Test pass
- Refactor

**Requirements drive the tests**

- Write a failing E2E Test
	- Write a failing Unit Test
	- Make the Unit Test pass
	- Refactor
- Integrate system

**TDD** is *component-based*

**BDD** is *feature-based* (the focus is more on the Business and expected behaviors of the feature)

When you have your specifications first, ahead of time (BDD), you have the answer key to your tests (which is the opposite of TDD).

##Tests vs. Specifications##

**TESTS**

- Written after Production code
- Don't always cover everything
- Detail-oriented

**SPECIFICATIONS**

- Written before production code
- Living documenation for project
- Higher-level stories
- Help design the solution

**Note:** *This session did not go over the actual implementations of BDD/Cucumber tests so I will play around with it and share my results.  I think it makes sense and provides another layer of bridging the gaps between business and developer requirements.*
